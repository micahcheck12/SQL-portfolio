--you can enjoy listening to these artists at the following playlist - https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0foDMV0RuKpF1fGuP3UPwv?si=f2723d1594804f10

--STEP 1: I needed to clean up the data: 
  -- The stage is NULL for several artists so I refrenced the lineup and filled in the stages that were missing.
  -- The Spotify Listeners data has a Ms and Ks for millions and thousands so I removed those in Excel and appended the appropriate 0s
