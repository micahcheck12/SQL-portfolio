--you can enjoy listening to these artists at the following playlist 
  - https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0foDMV0RuKpF1fGuP3UPwv?si=f2723d1594804f10

--STEP 1: CLEAN THE DATA 
  -- The stage is NULL for several artists so I refrenced the lineup and filled in the stages that were missing.
  -- The Spotify Listeners data has a Ms and Ks for millions and thousands so I removed those in Excel 
      and appended the appropriate 0s
  -- Gender had the type of artist in parentheses next to it.  I'd like to analyze that data so I made a new field 
      called type used text to columns in Excel seperated by space to move over.  I added Solo when it was just one gender.
